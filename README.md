# Install
You should probably just look through the files and yank something if you think
it looks nifty, programs i use are in `install.sh`, site-wide one-off config is
in `post-install.sh`, the rest is handled by `GNU Stow`, using `stow.sh` for
convenience.

# Theme
The font i use right now is [Source Code Pro](https://github.com/adobe-fonts/source-code-pro).

I try to stick to the [Zenburn colors](http://kippura.org/zenburnpage/), which
is also how my window manager, terminal, and emacs are styled.

For keybindings, etc. look at the relevant files (e.g. i3/confing for i3,
aliases.zsh/keybindings.zsh for terminal, etc.)
