# Install
You should probably just look through the files and yank something if
you think it looks nifty, if you absolutely want to get going quickly,
have a look at `install.sh` and `make-links.sh`.

# Theme
The font i use right now is [Source Code Pro](https://github.com/adobe-fonts/source-code-pro).

I try to stick to the
original [Zenburn colors](http://kippura.org/zenburnpage/), which is
also how my window manager, terminal, and emacs are styled.

For keybindings, etc. look at the relevant files (e.g. i3.conf for i3,
aliases.zsh/keybindings.zsh for terminal, ...)
